/**
 * Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of 'N' items,
 * we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit
 * such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number 'C'.
 * Write a function that returns the maximum profit. Each item can only be selected once,
 * which means either we put an item in the knapsack or skip it.
